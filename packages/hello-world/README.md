# Hello World

This is a test app for Managed Runtime, for internal use. 

This app purposefully has the smallest footprint possible, to help 
Salesforce staff talk about and test the feature-set of Managed Runtime
itself, without being distracted by the complex dependencies of
eg. the Retail React App.

Please do not add features to this app to make it an attractive starting
point for developer projects! We need something minimal for internal use.
Start a brand-new project template instead, if there's need for one.

This app is *intentionally not* a PWA â€“ MRT does not require it.

## Setup/Run/Deploy

```bash
npm ci
npm start
npm run push
```
