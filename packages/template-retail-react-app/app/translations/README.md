# Translations & Localization

Most of the files in this folder are generated by `react-intl` **CLI tool**:

-   `pwa/app/translations/en-GB.json` <- output of _extracting_ the default messages, which you can send to your translators
-   `pwa/app/translations/[locale].json` <- the files that your translators make for the other locales
-   `pwa/app/translations/compiled/[locale].json` <- output of _compiling_ the messages into AST format
    -   Compiling helps improve the performance because it allows `react-intl` to skip the parsing step

Several **npm scripts** are available to you that make it easier to use the CLI tool. See `pwa/package.json` for more details.

-   To **extract the default messages** in your app, run `npm run extract-default-translations` to have all of the default messages extracted into their own JSON file.
-   To **compile the translations** from all of the locales, run `npm run compile-translations`.
-   To run both an extract and compile, run `npm run build-translations`

## Supported Locales and Default Locale

The default locale, supported locales, and currency settings are defined in `pwa/package.json` in an object called `l10n`.

The locale ids in `pwa/package.json` follow the format supported by OCAPI and Commerce API: `<language code>-<country code>` as defined in this InfoCenter topic: [OCAPI localization 21.8](https://documentation.b2c.commercecloud.salesforce.com/DOC1/topic/com.demandware.dochelp/OCAPI/current/usage/Localization.html).

The currency code in `l10n.supportedCurrencies` and `l10n.supportedLocales[n].preferredCurrency` follow the ISO 4217 standard.

**Important**: The supported locale settings in `pwa/package.json` must match the locale settings for your B2C Commerce instance. For more information about configuring locales on a B2C Commerce instance, see this InfoCenter topic: [Configure Site Locales](https://documentation.b2c.commercecloud.salesforce.com/DOC2/topic/com.demandware.dochelp/content/b2c_commerce/topics/admin/b2c_configuring_site_locales.html).

Here’s an example of locale configuration in `pwa/package.json`:

```
"l10n": {
    "supportedCurrencies": [
        "GBP",
        "EUR",
        "CNY",
        "JPY"
    ],
    "defaultCurrency": "GBP",
    "supportedLocales": [
        {
            "id": "en-GB",
            "preferredCurrency": "GBP"
        },
        {
            "id": "fr-FR",
            "preferredCurrency": "EUR"
        },
        ...
    ],
    "defaultLocale": "en-GB"
}
```

## Formatting Messages

For all of the hardcoded messages in your site, write them...

-   _inline_ in the components, so it’s easier to see where in the page or component that they get used in
-   and in the **default locale** (for example, in English)

For example, in your React component, you can add formatted messages like `intl.formatMessage({defaultMessage: '...'})` or `<FormattedMessage defaultMessage="..." />`

### Adding Message Id

At the minimum, only defaultMessage is the required parameter. The message id is optional. If you don’t specify it, the id is auto-generated for you.

## Testing with a Pseudo Locale

To check whether you’ve wrapped all of the hardcoded strings with either `intl.formatMessage()` or `<FormattedMessage />` , there’s a quick way to test that by running `npm run start:pseudolocale`. It runs your local dev server with the locale forced to the pseudo locale.

Loading the site in your browser, you can quickly see that those messages that have been formatted would look like this: `[!! Ṕŕíííṿâćććẏ ṔṔṔŏĺíííćẏ !!]`

## How to Add a New Locale

The process for adding a new locale is as follows:

1. Create/enable the new locale in Business Manager of your B2C Commerce instance
2. Enable the locale's currency too in Business Manager
3. Add the new locale and its currency to `pwa/package.json`
4. If the new locale is your new default locale:
    - Update your React components' default messages to the new default locale's language
    - In `pwa/package.json`, set the new default locale
    - Run `npm run extract-default-translations` to extract the new default locale's translations into `pwa/app/translations/[defaultLocale].json`
    - Send the extracted translations to your translation team
5. Place the files you receive from your translation team into the `pwa/app/translations/` folder
6. Run `npm run compile-translations`

## Tips

Here are a few useful things to know for developers.

### User-Preferred Locales vs. App-Supported Locales

How a locale gets chosen depends on whether there’s a match found between 2 sets of locales. On a high level, it looks like this:

1. Get the app-supported locales, which are defined in `pwa/package.json` (under `l10n.supportedLocales` ).
2. Get the user-preferred locales, which are what the visitors prefer to see. The developer is responsible for fully implementing them in their own projects within the special `_app` component.
3. If there’s a match between these 2 sets of locales, then the app would use it as the target locale.
4. Otherwise, the app would fall back to its default locale (which is defined in `package.json` under `l10n.defaultLocale` ).

### How to Detect the Active Locale

-   Within component render, `useIntl` hook is available to you: `const {locale} = useIntl()`
-   Within a page’s `getProps` there’s a `params` prop (specifically `params.locale`) coming from the routes that can tell you about which locale is being used in the current page URL.

### Dynamic Loading of the Translation Files

Using dynamic import, regardless of how many locales the app supports, it would load only one locale at a time.

Initially, on app load, the translated messages are part of the server-rendered html. Afterwards on the client side, when dynamically changing the locale, the app would download the JSON file associated with that locale.

-   Each locale is a separate JSON file in the bundle. And it’s served with a 1-year cache header.
-   When a new bundle is deployed, you must download the JSON files again.

### Link Component

The generated project comes with its own `Link` component. It automatically inserts the locale in the URLs for you.
