# The Retail React App

A project template that includes an isomorphic JavaScript storefront and [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/). It uses a modern headless architecture that enables developers to decouple front-end code from back-end systems. It leverages popular open-source libraries in the React ecosystem, such as [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) components, [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) (CSS-in-JS), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), and many more.

Developers don’t have to worry about the underlying infrastructure, whether they’re developing their app locally, deploying it to a [Managed Runtime](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/guide/mrt-overview.html) environment, or testing the app live.

## Requirements

-   Node 14
-   npm 6.14.4 or later

## Get Started

To start your web server for local development, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm start
```

Now that the development server is running, you can open a browser and preview your commerce app:

-   Go to http://localhost:3000/

## Localization

See the [Localization README.md](./app/translations/README.md) for important setup instructions for localization.

## Configuration Files

The Retail React App's configuration files are located in the `app/config` folder. For more details, see [Configuration Files](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/guide/configuration-options.html) in the documentation.
