# Description 

This folder will house a sample PWA-Kit project built using the `template-typescript-minimal` base project. Its
purpose is to test the Application Extension being developed without having to manually install it in another 
project. 

Additionally we'll update the `create-app` project so that we can generate a stub implementation of an Application
Extensions. This will reduce the friction for "Extension Developers", it will also allow use to use TypeScript
soley.
