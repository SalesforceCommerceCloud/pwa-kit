 * The PWAApp is a special component that will be overridden in your project. Its
 * main purpose is to provide the layout for your application as well as set up any
 * global actions and data fetching via the `getProps` method. Typically this is
 * where you will set up components like your application header, footer and
 * navigation. The contents of this component are project specific, but the rule
 * of thumb is that anything outside of your pages will be added here.
