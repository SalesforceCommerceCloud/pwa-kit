# PWA Kit Generated App

Welcome to the PWA Kit!

## Getting Started

### Requirements

-   Node 18 or later
-   npm 9 or later

### Run the Project Locally

```bash
npm start
```

This will open a browser and your storefront will be running on http://localhost:3000

### Deploy to Managed Runtime

```
npm run push -- -m "Message to help you recognize this bundle"
```

**Note**: This command will push to the MRT project that matches the name field in `package.json`. To push to a different project, include the `-s` argument.

**Important**: Access to the [Runtime Admin](https://runtime.commercecloud.com/) application is required to deploy bundles. To learn more, read our guide to [Push and Deploy Bundles](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/guide/pushing-and-deploying-bundles.html).

## Customizing the application

This version of the application uses [Template Extensibility](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/guide/template-extensibility.html) to empower you to more easily customize base templates. Please refer to our documentation for more information.

## üåç Localization
