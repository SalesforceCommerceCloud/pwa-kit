# Progressive Web App

This package is your PWA. It supports server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side
rendering. You can develop both locally using the same codebase.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Running Your PWA

To start the Server Side Rendering (SSR) server, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

The start command prints the URL you need to open in your browser to the console.


## Building Your PWA

Your project comes with a sample Commerce Integrations connector as well as examples
for home, product-listing and product description pages.

Our sample pages include links to sections in our documentation that show you how to
customize your PWA using our tools by including forms, modals, navigation, etc.
We recommend you run your PWA and explore the sample pages to get a feel for where
to begin.
