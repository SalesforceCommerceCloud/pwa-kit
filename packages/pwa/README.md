# The Retail React App

The Retail React App is an isomorphic JavaScript storefront and [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/). It uses a modern headless architecture that enables developers to decouple the frontend from backend systems. It leverages popular open-source libraries in the React ecosystem, such as [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) components, [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) (CSS-in-JS), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), and many more.

Developers enjoy a streamlined experience without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure, whether they're developing their app locally, deploying it to a [Managed Runtime](https://developer.commercecloud.com/s/article/Managed-Runtime-Infrastructure) environment, or testing the app live.

## Requirements

```
  Node ^12.x or ^14.x
  npm ^6.14.4
```

## Getting Started

To start your web server for local development, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm start
```

Now that the development server is running, you can open a browser and preview your commerce app:

-   Go to http://localhost:3000/

## Localization

See the [Localization README.md](./app/translations/README.md) for important setup instructions for localization.
