/**
 * Returns the express app configuration file in object form. The file will be resolved in the
 * the following order:
 *
 * {deploy_target}.ext - When the DEPLOY_TARGET environment is set (predominantly on remote environments)
 * a file aptly named after the environment will be loaded first. Examples of this are `production.json`, or
 * `development.json`.
 *
 * local.ext - Only loaded on local development environments, this file is used if you want a custom
 * configuration that will not be used on deployed remote environments.
 *
 * default.ext - If you have no requirement for environment specific configurations the `default`
 * config file will be used.
 *
 * package.json - If none of the files after have been found the `mobify` object defined in the
 * projects `package.json` file.
 *
 * Each file marked with `ext` can optionally be terminated with `js`, `yml|yaml` or
 * `json`. The file loaded is also determined based on that precidence of file extension.
 *
 * @returns - the application configuration object.
