/**
 * Use properties of the request, such as URL and querystring, to generate
 * a cache key string suitable for passing to sendResponseFromCache or
 * storeResponseInCache.
 *
 * This method is provided as a convenience: you do not have to use it,
 * but it should cover the most common use cases. It is the default
 * cache key generator used by sendResponseFromCache and
 * storeResponseInCache. If you override the cache key function
 * in the options for storeResponseInCache, you may call this function
 * and then further modify the returned key.
 *
 * The cache key is based on the request's path (case-independent) and
 * querystring (case-dependent). The order of parameters in the querystring
 * is important: if the order changes, the cache key changes. This is done
 * because the order of query parameters is important for some systems.
 *
 * To allow for simple extension of the default algorithm, the optional
 * 'options.extras' parameter may be used to pass an array of strings that
 * will also be used (in the order they are passed) to build the key.
 * Undefined values are allowed in the extras array.
 *
 * By default, the key generation does NOT consider the Accept,
 * Accept-Charset or Accept-Language request header values. If it's
 * appropriate to include these, the caller should add their values
 * (or values based on them) to the options.extras array.
 *
 * Requests that come to a deployed Express app contain headers that
 * identify the device type. By default, this method generates different
 * cache keys for different device types (effectively, the values of the
 * headers used by getBrowserSize are included in 'options.extras'). To
 * suppress this, pass true for options.ignoreDeviceType
 * Note: CloudFront will pass 4 device type headers, and ALL of them will
 * be present in the request headers, they are 'CloudFront-Is-Desktop-Viewer',
 * 'CloudFront-Is-Mobile-Viewer', 'CloudFront-Is-SmartTV-Viewer' and
 * 'CloudFront-Is-Tablet-Viewer'. The values can be 'true' or 'false', and it
 * is possible that a device falls into more than one device type category
 * and multiple device type headers can be 'true' at the same time.
 *
 * By default, method will generate different cache keys for requests with
 * different request classes (effectively, the value of the request-class
 * string is included in 'extras'). To suppress this, pass true for
 * options.ignoreRequestClass
 *
 * @param req {IncomingMessage} the request to generate the key for.
 * @param [options] {Object} values that affect the cache key generation.
 * @param [options.extras] {Array<String|undefined>} extra string values
 * to be included in the key.
 * @param [options.ignoreDeviceType] {Boolean} set this to true to suppress
 * automatic variation of the key by device type.
 * @param [options.ignoreRequestClass] {Boolean} set this to true to suppress
 * automatic variation of the key by request class.
 * @returns {String} the generated key.
