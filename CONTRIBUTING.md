This repository is a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) that includes the code that powers the PWA Kit. The code is divided into the following packages:

- `internal-lib-build`: A package that contains internal tools used by other libraries in the monorepo 
- `pwa-kit-dev`: A set of commands to build PWA Kit projects
- `pwa-kit-create-app`: A tool that generates PWA Kit projects based on the Retail React App template
- `pwa-kit-react-sdk`: A set of components and utilities for PWA Kit projects
- `pwa-kit-runtime`: A package that contains runtime environments for applications to run on Managed Runtime
- `template-express-minimal`: A project template that can be used as a starting point for a generic Express application (does not include React)
- `template-retail-react-app`: A project template that can be used as a starting point for a full retail storefront
- `template-typescript-minimal`: A project template with TypeScript support that can be used as a starting point for React projects

## üì¶ Dependencies

Behind the scenes, we use [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to manage the monorepo. Lerna lets
us install all dependencies and link all packages together with one command:

```bash
npm ci
```

Dependencies that are added to the `package.json` file at the root of the
repo are shared between packages. Dependencies listed in the
`package.json` files within each individual package directory work as normal.

## üèóÔ∏è Cleaning & Rebuilding

When you pull changes that include modifications to any package‚Äôs dependencies, run `npm ci` from the top-level directory (`pwa-kit`). This command cleans and reinstalls all packages. Run this command frequently during development to ensure that you‚Äôre using the same package versions as everyone else.

For more information, see the [Lerna docs](https://lerna.js.org/).

## üëì Linting

```bash
  npm run lint
```

## üß™ Testing

Run tests for all packages with:

```bash
  cd [repo root]
  npm test
```

## üêõ Issues

If you‚Äôre experiencing an issue, check the open issues first. If someone hasn‚Äôt already raised the same issue, file a new issue with a description of the problem and describe the steps to reproduce it. If you require an urgent response to your issue, file a support ticket with [Salesforce Commerce Cloud](https://help.salesforce.com/). You can also create an issue to request a new feature.

## üéÅ Submit a Pull Request

> **Note**: All your commits must be signed. To learn how to set up commit signing, see this help doc from GitHub: [Managing Commit Signature Verification](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification).

## üèÖ Best Practices

-   When logging an issue or creating a pull request for the first time, tell us a bit about yourself. Do you work for a Salesforce customer or partner organization? What PWA Kit projects are you actively working on?
-   To reduce merge conflicts, squash and rebase your branch before submitting your pull request.
-   In your pull request, include:
    -   A brief description of the problem and your solution
    -   Steps to reproduce
    -   Screenshots
    -   Error logs (if applicable)
-   Make sure that your code builds successfully and passes the unit tests. Refer to the README for steps on how to run tests.
-   Monitor your pull requests. Respond in a timely manner to any comments, questions, and change requests.

## üëÄ Review Process

After submitting a pull request, the PWA Kit team will review it and consider it for merging.

The team periodically closes any abandoned pull requests that they find.
