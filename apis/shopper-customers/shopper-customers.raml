            Obtains a new JSON Web Token (JWT) for a guest or registered
            customer. Tokens are returned as an HTTP `Authorization: Bearer` response
            header entry. The following kinds of request are supported, as specified by the
            `type`:

            - `{"type": "guest"}` → Creates a guest (non-authenticated) customer and returns a token for the customer.
            - `{"type": "credentials"}` → Authenticates credentials passed in the `HTTP Authorization: Basic` request header and returns a token for a successfully authenticated customer (otherwise, it throws an `AuthenticationFailedException`). This type of request also updates profile attributes for the customer (for example, `last-visited`) and handles the maximum number of failed login attempts.
            - `{"type": "refresh"}` → Examines the token passed in the `HTTP Authorization: Bearer` request header. If valid, a new token is returned with an updated expiry time.

            The JWT contains 3 sections:

            1. Header: Specifies token type and algorithm used.
            2. Payload: Contains customer information, client ID, issue, and expiration time.
            3. Signature: Records the token signature.

            A token is created and returned to the client whenever a registered customer logs in (`credentials` type) or a guest customer requests it (`guest` type). The token is returned in the response header as `Authorization: Bearer --token--`.

            The client has to include the token in the request header as `Authorization: Bearer --token--` in any follow-up request. The server declines any follow-up requests without a token. The server declines any requests that cannot be verified based on the token signature or expiration time. A token nearing its expiration time should be exchanged for a new one (`refresh` type).

          🚨 **DEPRECATION NOTICE**

          To enhance the security and availability of Salesforce services, this endpoint is now **deprecated**, and **we plan to remove it in mid-2022**. This endpoint is not available to new customers, and we discourage existing customers from using it. Instead, we strongly recommend using the endpoints of the [Shopper Login and API Access Service](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/commerce-api/references?meta=shopper-login:Summary) (SLAS) because they meet our rigorous standards for security and availability.

          ---

          Obtain the JSON Web Token (JWT) for registered customers whose credentials are stored using a third party system. Accepts `loginId` and 
          `clientId`, returns a customer object in the response body and the JWT generated against the `clientId` in the response header.
