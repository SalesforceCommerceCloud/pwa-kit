## :warning: Planned API Changes :warning:

### Shopper Context

Starting July 31st 2024, all endpoints in the Shopper context API will require the `siteId` parameter for new customers. This field is marked as optional for backward compatibility and will be changed to mandatory tentatively by January 2025. You can read more about the planned change [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/commerce-api/references/shopper-context?meta=Summary) in the notes section.

### Shopper Login (SLAS)

SLAS will soon require new tenants to pass `channel_id` as an argument for retrieving guest access tokens. You can read more about the planned change [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/commerce-api/guide/slas.html#guest-tokens).

Please be aware that existing tenants are on a temporary allow list and will see no immediate disruption to service.  We do ask that all users seek to adhere to the `channel_id` requirement before the end of August to enhance your security posture before the holiday peak season.

### Summary of Changes for PWA Kit v2

To comply with the planned API changes effective July 31st, 2024, you need to update your PWA Kit v2 projects. These changes involve adding the `channel_id` parameter for Shopper Login and optionally scoping your local storage keys and cookie names with the `siteId` prefix if your site uses multisite.

**1. Update `auth.js` to Include `channel_id` in Calls to Shopper Login**

Add the `channel_id` parameter in the appropriate functions for obtaining tokens.

#### Example Changes:
```diff
// In the Auth class, add channel_id to the data in loginWithCredentials method
data.append('channel_id', this._config.parameters.siteId)

// In the refreshToken method, add channel_id to the data
data.append('channel_id', this._config.parameters.siteId)
```

**2. Scope Local Storage Keys and Cookie Names per Site for Multisite Projects**

For customers using multiple site IDs, it is recommended to scope your local storage keys and cookie names per site to avoid conflicts. This ensures that tokens from different sites (e.g., RefArch and RefArchGlobal) are not incorrectly used across sites.

```diff
// Add siteId parameter in LocalStorage and CookieStorage constructors
constructor(siteId, ...args) {
super(args);
if (typeof window === 'undefined') {
throw new Error('LocalStorage is not available in the current environment.');
}
this.siteId = siteId;
}

// Create storage key with siteId prefix
createStorageKey(key) {
return `${this.siteId}_${key}`;
}

// Set item in local storage with siteId prefix
set(key, value) {
window.localStorage.setItem(this.createStorageKey(key), value);
}

// Get item from local storage with siteId prefix
get(key) {
return window.localStorage.getItem(this.createStorageKey(key));
}

// Delete item from local storage with siteId prefix
delete(key) {
window.localStorage.removeItem(this.createStorageKey(key));
}

// Similar changes for CookieStorage
```
